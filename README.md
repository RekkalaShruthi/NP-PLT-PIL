# NP-PLT-PIL
Here, we used the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to upload an Image, the Numpy library to convert it to an array, and the Matplotlib library to perform various colour transformations on the image.
Due to memory limitations, the code file does not have any outputs; nonetheless, a PDF file is included with outputs for cross-checking purposes.
